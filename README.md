# Knowledge Base Construction from Pre-trained Language Models (LM-KBC) 2nd Edition

This repository contains dataset for the LM-KBC challenge at ISWC 2023.

## Dataset v0.9

Preliminary release of the LM-KBC dataset.

### Note

The released dataset is primarily for understanding the format. We are making a few quality checks and the changes to the final version will be minor. The final dataset will be added here within a few days.

### Coming up next

- Baseline scripts (BERT baseline, GPT-3 baseline, both including a baseline entity disambiguation)
- Evaluation script (for illustration consider last year's version, with the important difference, that this year, we evaluate matches based on unique Wikidata IDs, not surface forms)
